2. Download latest version of template.zip from the source code [here](template.zip).
3. Install NodeJS from [here (https://nodejs.org/en/download)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Make sure to install the LTS version and to restart your computer after installing.
4. Extract template.zip and make sure to put the folder inside called `template` in the same folder as creator.js.

## Usage
1. Run creator.js by running ```node creator.js``` in the command prompt. If you get an error, make sure you have installed NodeJS correctly.
2. Follow the instructions in the command prompt. [^1]
3. This will create a folder called `output` in the same folder as creator.js. This folder will contain a folder called `assets`, which you can copy over to your texture pack.
4. Now you can edit the textures in your own texture pack and use them in Minecraft.
